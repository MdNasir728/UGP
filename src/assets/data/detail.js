    subtitle: "Understanding the Measurement of Acidity and Alkalinity",
    introduction: "pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. It indicates the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, where 7 is considered neutral. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic, while those with a pH greater than 7 are alkaline.",
